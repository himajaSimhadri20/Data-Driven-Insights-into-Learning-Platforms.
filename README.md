This repository contains the Power BI dashboard for analyzing Online course data. The dashboard provides insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) such as student enrollment, course popularity, revenue generation, and instructor performance.

**Key Features:**

*   **Data Visualization:** Employs a visually appealing and informative design, utilizing a combination of charts and card-based visualizations to present key metrics and insights in a clear and concise manner.
*   **KPIs:** Calculates and displays key performance indicators such as:
    *   Total Students (Card with a pie chart)
    *   Number of Courses (Card with a stacked bar chart)
    *   Number of Instructors (Card with an icon representing instructors)
    *   Revenue (Card with a currency symbol)
    *   Average Pricing (Card with a currency symbol)
    *   Average Time Effort (Card with a clock icon)
    *   Average Course Length (Card with a calendar icon)
*   **Course Analysis:** Analyzes course popularity, identifies top-enrolled courses ("The Science of Happiness," "Introduction to Computer Science"), and provides a breakdown of courses by level (Introductory, Intermediate, Advanced).
*   **User Segmentation:** Provides insights into user demographics, including language preferences (English, Spanish, French, etc.) and preferred learning methods (self-paced vs. instructor-led).

**Technical Skills Demonstrated:**

*   **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** Data was cleaned and prepared for analysis, handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.
*   **Data Modeling:** A data model was created to establish relationships between tables (e.g., courses, students, instructors) to enable accurate analysis.
*   **DAX Measures:** DAX measures were used to calculate key performance indicators and enable dynamic calculations within the dashboard.
*   **Data Visualization:** A variety of visualizations were created, including pie charts, bar charts, and text boxes, to effectively communicate data insights and trends.
*   **Dashboard Design:** The dashboard is designed with a clean and professional layout, utilizing card-based visualizations to present key metrics in a concise and easily understandable format for stakeholders.

**Insights and Observations:**
*   The platform boasts a large user base with over 45 million students.
*   The course catalog is diverse, offering 970 courses across various subjects.
*   "The Science of Happiness" and "Introduction to Computer Science" are among the most popular courses.
*   The dashboard provides valuable insights into user behavior, course performance, and platform trends.
